        <h2><a href="#lisp">What is Lisp?</a></h2>
        <p id="lisp">
            One of the foundational languages of the computer age. First described in 1960, it has influenced
            generations of language design down to the present, including "big" languages (Java), dynamic languages
            popular in web
            development (JavaScript, Python, Ruby), and advanced functional languages (Haskell, Scala, Clojure).

        <h2><a href="#scheme">What is Scheme?</a></h2>
        <p id="scheme">
            A dialect of Lisp, first described in 1975. It adds several powerful facilities to the core semantics of
            Lisp, and its formal but succinct specification has made it one of the most
            widely implemented computer languages.

            Yes. <br/>
            Software claiming to be implementations of Scheme in JavaScript is abundant.
            Most provide the core procedure-evaluation semantics, but fail to provide major features that Scheme requires:
            hygienic macros, first-class continuations, true tail recursion, and so on.<br />

            Also, no JavaScript Scheme implementation I am aware of uses a standard library (macros and procedures) written in Scheme,
            a fact that ought to decrease confidence in their correctness.
