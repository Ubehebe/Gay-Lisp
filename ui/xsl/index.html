                <dd>
                    <p>Lisp is one of the oldest and most influential programming languages. Kind of like Latin is to European languages.</p>
                    <p>Scheme is a modern dialect of Lisp, renowned for its beauty but seldom used in the real world. Kind of like Italian.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What is r5js?</dt>
                <dd><p>An interpreter for <a href="https://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML">R<sup>5</sup>RS Scheme </a> that runs in the browser, no plugins or downloads required. You can also run it on a server, using <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a>.</p></dd>
                <dt>What do I need to run r5js?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>If you are reading this, r5js is <a href="#play">probably running</a> on your device.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>How does it work?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>There is a regex-based scanner and a recursive descent parser, both handwritten.</p>
                    <p>Programs are incrementally transformed into continuation-passing style and evaluated on a trampoline.</p>
                    <p>Primitive Scheme values are implemented by their primitive JavaScript counterparts as much as practical; in particular, the semantics of numerical operations are mostly those of JavaScript, while still complying with the Scheme standard.</p>
                    <p>All the non-primitive syntax and procedures are written in Scheme and loaded at boot time.</p>
