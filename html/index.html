    </hgroup>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is Lisp?</dt>
        <dd>One of the oldest and most influential programming languages. Kind of like Latin is to European languages.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is Scheme?</dt>
        <dd>A modern dialect of Lisp, renowned for its beauty but seldom used in the real world. Kind of like Italian.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is Gay Lisp?</dt>
        <dd>A Scheme interpreter conforming to <a href="#spec" class="vis-manager">R<sup>5</sup>RS</a> that runs 100% in
            the browser, no plugins or downloads required. You can also run it on a server.
        </dd>
        <dt>What do I need to run Gay Lisp?</dt>
        <dd>If you are reading this, Gay Lisp is <a href="#repl" class="vis-manager">probably running</a> on your
            computer.
            Gay Lisp is written in an unfancy version of JavaScript that has been included in browsers for more than a
            decade, so it should work even in non-contemporary browsers. Of course, it will not work if you have
            disabled JavaScript.<br/>
            This website, however, uses some more recent bells and whistles, so an up-to-date browser is recommended.
        </dd>
        <dt>How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>There is a regex-based scanner and a recursive descent parser, both handwritten.
            Programs are incrementally transformed into continuation-passing style and evaluated on a trampoline.
            Primitive Scheme values are implemented by their primitive JavaScript counterparts as much as practical;
            in particular, the semantics of numerical operations is mostly that of JavaScript, while still complying
            with the Scheme standard.
            All the non-primitive syntax and procedures are written in Scheme and loaded at boot time.
        </dd>
        <dt>Is the phrase “the first standards-compliant Scheme that runs in the browser” justified?</dt>
        <dd>
            I believe so. Most JavaScript Scheme implementations provide a useful subset of Scheme without aiming for
            compliance with any standard.
            Typically, this means standard features that significantly complicate the implementation are omittted:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.biwascheme.org/">BiwaScheme</a> lacks macros.</li>
                <li><a href="http://fargo.jcoglan.com/">Fargo</a> has incomplete library support (no
                    <code>dynamic-wind</code>, <code>call-with-values</code>, etc.)
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/jsscheme/">jsScheme</a> does not support nested ellipses in
                    macro transformers.
                    This means the implementation cannot provide the <a href="#do-definition" class="vis-manager"
                                                                        data-target="#spec">canonical definition of
                        <code>do</code></a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            By contrast, Gay Lisp aims for complete compliance with R<sup>5</sup>RS.
            You can jump between the <a href="#spec" class="vis-manager">specification</a> and the <a href="#repl"
                                                                                                      class="vis-manager">implementation</a>
            in order to test features.
            And you can run every example in the specification straight from the specification.<br/>
            Please <a href="https://github.com/Ubehebe/Gay-Lisp/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a> if you know of a
            more complete JavaScript Scheme implementation.
        </dd>
        <dt>Why are you targeting R<sup>5</sup>RS instead of the newer <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R<sup>6</sup>RS
            standard</a>?
        </dt>
        <dd>As of early 2012, the status of R<sup>6</sup>RS as a community standard is in doubt. There is <a
                href="http://scheme-reports.org/2009/position-statement.html">talk
            of splitting standarization efforts into two tracks</a>, one of which could abrogate features introduced by
            R<sup>6</sup>RS.
        </dd>
        <dt>Is this useful for anything?</dt>
        <dd>There is some experimental DOM interoperability:
            <dl class="ex">
                <dt>((window 'alert) "hello from Scheme!")</dt>
                <dd>"hello from Scheme!"</dd>
            </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>Why?</dt>
        <dd><em>[Channeling George Mallory and George Costanza]</em> Because it's there.</dd>
        <dt>I don't get the pun.</dt>
        <dd>...</dd>
